# Project organization

## Python files:

1. **rar_to_spec.py**: this files turns .rar files into spectrograms (.png and .npy), however, there seems to be a mismatch between the output of this file with the data we were given.

2. **detection**: simple detection program, rule based and cannot tell apart drones. Seems to work best with our own processed data (from the raw files) instead of using the provided.

3. **train.py**: trains a model very slowly for the data of the *DroneRFb-Spectra*, it may be outdated.

4. **train_speed.py**: trains a model for the data of the *DroneRFb-Spectra*, the difference is that it tries to use all possible computing resources.

5. **test.py**: give it a .npy file and it tries to see which drone it correlates to. Can also be given a dataset.


# Drone RF Signal Classification System  
## Technical Documentation  

### 1. System Overview  
This project implements a **deep learning-based RF signal classification system** for drone identification. The system processes spectrogram representations of RF signals to classify them into 24 distinct drone types or identify them as "Unknown" when they don't match any known pattern. The solution achieves **98.66% overall accuracy** with robust open-set recognition capabilities.

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline  

#### Input Representation  
- **Raw Data**: RF signal spectrograms (512×512, 100MHz bandwidth, center frequencies: 915MHz/2.44GHz/5.80GHz)  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Resized to 256×256 for computational efficiency  
  - Normalized to [0, 1] range:  
    `spec = (spec - min(spec)) / (max(spec) - min(spec) + 1e-8)`  
  - Converted to single-channel format (256×256×1)  

#### Dataset Structure  
- **Total Samples**: 14,484 spectrograms  
- **Classes**: 24 distinct drone types (including background RF signals)  
- **Split**: 80% training (11,587 samples), 20% validation (2,897 samples)  
- **Class Distribution**: Balanced across all drone types

### 4. Classification Mechanism  

#### Standard Classification  
1. Spectrogram is processed through CNN  
2. Output layer produces probability distribution across 24 classes  
3. Highest probability class is selected as prediction  

#### Open-Set Detection  
1. **Class Centers**: Mean embedding vector for each drone class (calculated from training data)  
2. **Threshold Calculation**:  
   - For each class:  
     `threshold = mean_distance + 2 × std_distance`  
   - Where `mean_distance` and `std_distance` are computed from training samples to class center  
3. **Unknown Detection**:  
   - Calculate Euclidean distance between input embedding and closest class center  
   - If `distance > threshold` → Classify as "Unknown"  
   - Confidence score: `1 - (distance / threshold)`  

#### Implementation Notes  
- **Embedding Model**: Dedicated submodel extracting features from "embedding_layer"  
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Runs on CPU-only systems (tested on ThinkPad with 16GB RAM)  
- **Deployment**: Single-file inference with 32ms average processing time
